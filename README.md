# Water Classification Project

This project analyzes a dataset of water samples to classify them as portable or unportable. It utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with hyperparameter tuning. The dataset features include pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity, and Potability.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
1. Dataset Exploration: Analyze the dataset features and gain insights into the water samples.

2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize features, and perform necessary transformations.

3. Model Training: Utilize Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM algorithms with hyperparameter tuning to train classification models.

4. Model Evaluation: Measure model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Comparative Analysis: Compare the accuracies of different machine learning models to identify the most effective algorithm for water classification.
